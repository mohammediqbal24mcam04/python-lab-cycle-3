4. Write a program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion.
5. Write a program to add variable length integer arguments passed to the

6. Write lambda functions to find the area of square, rectangle and triangle.
7. Write a program to display powers of 2 using anonymous function.[Hint use
map and lambda function)
8. Write a program to sum the series 1/1! + 4/2! + 27/3! +
â€¦..
+ nth term. [ Hint
